/** 
@mainpage libsyndication - An RSS/Atom parser library

libsyndication is a parser library for RSS and Atom feeds.
RSS (0.9/1.0, 0.91..2.0) and Atom (0.3 and 1.0) feeds are supported.
It offers a unified, format-agnostic view on the parsed feed, 
so that the using application doesn't need to distinguish between feed formats.
