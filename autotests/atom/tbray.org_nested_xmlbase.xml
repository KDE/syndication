<p>A friend was telling me of a young woman he knows who’d been struggling to
get by in New
York and he’d been sort of mentoring.  Only she’s spent most of this year
traveling in Southeast Asia and South America, “finding herself”.</p>
<p>I wondered what she was living on.
Turns out she’s offering her Manhattan apartment on Airbnb and covering its
rent with enough left over to fuel her nomadic self-discovery.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s even legal? Whatever, when there’s something desirable to be sold
and people who want to buy it, deals get done; particularly in NYC.  A
21st-century lifestyle, to be sure.</p>
