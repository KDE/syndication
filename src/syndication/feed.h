/**
 * This class represents a feed document ("Channel" in RSS, "Feed" in Atom).

 * format-agnostic, unified view on the document.
 * This way applications using the syndication library have no need to care
 * about the syndication format jungle at all. If necessary, format details and
 * specialities can be accessed using the specificDocument() method.
